# Dummy Microfrontend Architecture

This is an example of how can we build microfrontends that can be used in isolation or inside a container and decide in which part of our application we fetch those microfrontends

This project has 3 folders which can be run individually

## Installing dependencies

execute 

``
npm install
``

in container, cart and products.

## Run project

To run every microfrontend execute
``
npm start
``

In order to fetch cart and products inside container you must have the three applications running
